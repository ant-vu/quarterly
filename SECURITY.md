Security Policy

This document describes how to report security vulnerabilities, what to include in a report, and how we handle disclosures.

Preferred reporting channels

- GitHub Security Advisories (recommended): Create a private security advisory for this repository so maintainers and security teams can coordinate privately.
- If you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, contact the repository owner via the contact information listed on their GitHub profile (`ant-vu`). Do not publish exploit details publicly before a fix is available.

What to include in a report

- **Short description**: One-line summary of the issue.
- **Affected component(s)**: File, package, module, or feature.
- **Affected versions**: The version range where the issue exists.
- **Impact**: What an attacker can do (data disclosure, remote code execution, privilege escalation, etc.).
- **Steps to reproduce / Proof of concept**: Clear, minimal steps or code demonstrating the issue.
- **Suggested mitigation**: If you have a recommended fix or workaround, include it.
- **Optional**: Screenshots, logs, or sample payloads.

Triage and response

- We aim to acknowledge receipt within 3 business days.
- After triage, we will coordinate a remediation plan and target timelines. Expect follow-ups within 7 calendar days after acknowledgement.

Disclosure policy

- Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until a fix is released or we explicitly agree on coordinated disclosure.
- Default disclosure timeline is 90 days from initial report; we may agree on a shorter or longer timeline depending on severity and remediation complexity.

CVE and credit

- We will coordinate assignment of a CVE (or other identifiers) for confirmed vulnerabilities when appropriate.
- Security researchers who follow this disclosure process will be credited in release notes or an acknowledgements section, unless they request anonymity.

> Emergency or if you cannot use the channels above

- If an urgent or high-risk vulnerability requires immediate attention and you cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, locate the repository owner's contact information on their GitHub profile and send an encrypted report. If no contact information is available, open a sensitive issue and clearly mark it as security-related — maintainers will triage it privately where possible.

Safe harbor

- We will not pursue legal action against good-faith security research that follows this policy.

Questions or changes

- If you have questions about this policy or want to provide a preferred secure contact method (PGP key, dedicated email), open an issue or contact the repository owner so we can add it to this file.
